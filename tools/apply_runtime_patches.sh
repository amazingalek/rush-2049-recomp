# Patches the submodules under lib: each project gets the web support first, N64Recomp-browser's
# patches/<name>.patch, then this game's own changes, runtime-patches/<name>-*.patch in order of name. The projects
# are the rows of N64Recomp-browser's patches/patches.txt, which says where each one is (rt64/src/contrib/plume,
# N64ModernRuntime/N64Recomp), and the submodules pin the upstream commits named there, the ones those patches were
# made on (CLAUDE.md, "The web target"). Patches already applied are skipped, and so is a project that isn't checked
# out. Run after cloning or updating submodules, and again after pulling new patches.
# Which patches are applied is found on a scratch copy of the files they touch: they are reversed there newest first,
# so a patch whose lines a later one changed reverses once that one is off, and each one that reverses was applied.
# A checkout can hold a later patch without an earlier one, if a patch was added or edited on main after the others
# were applied. Then the applied ones after the first missing one come off and everything from it goes
# on in order, so the tree is the same as a fresh checkout's. The whole set is tried on the copy first, and a patch
# that doesn't apply (the submodule has other changes, or an applied patch was since edited, as N64Recomp-browser's
# are when it moves) stops the script before the submodule is touched.
